**Yeeeeeeeeeaaaah.** [TheToddTime.com][1] – it probably helps if you’re a fan of Scrubs. And crazy.

**Quote of the day.** Once again it’s [something JR said][2].

> Again, the biggest problem with social networking sites is that they were
created by people who don’t have friends.

The quote itself is both a bit inflammatory and highly hilarious, I agree, but
the rest of his posts makes perfect sense and also reflects my point of view
pretty much 100%.
