Dana is rebuilding our lovely little garden behind the house. We’ll get our
[new car][1] on Friday (YAY!), and I’m having a frickin’ ear infection, which
caused my doctor to cram some tissue and gel-stuff into it.

It seems to help, but I’m basically half-deaf now. At least temporarily. I’m
allowed to get rid of the things tomorrow, but daaaaaaamn, it sucks. :P

So, I’m a little cranky. Weeee.
