Thank the Gods, the _huge_ pile I’ve found on the sidewalk next to our door
was just the remains of a friendly neighbour’s dog! Phew.

I mean, you might expect me to be upset since said friendly neighbour was too
fucking lazy to pick up the steaming heap of crap his goddamn (and obviously
horse-sized) mongrel left behind, but nooooo… not me.

Because for a moment I was _seriously_ afraid some sort of monstrous mutant
mole had broken through the asphalt and was now terrorising my ‘hood, but --
_phew!_ -- it was just pooch poop.

A felt metric ton, no less.

Like, _10 meters_ from my door.

Motherfucks.
