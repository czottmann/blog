[Jakob Nielsen’s bi-weekly ‘Alertbox’ column][1], aptly labeled _“Current
Issues in Web **Usability**“_, does not offer an RSS feed. Why is that?

It’s published for 12 years straight by now (seriously: wow), still no feed.

(There are a number of scraped ones, including [one I’ve made][2] myself, but
that’s not the point. Shouldn’t there be something official?)

Just wondering.
