I'm not going to answer people anymore when I'm in the bathroom. You're
outside, I'm inside for stuff not of concern to you, there's a closed door
between us, and I am _not_ crying for help. So - go away.

If I'd want to communicate, I'd either face you or contact you, but I'd not
hide in a little box to do it. Get the message?

GO AWAY.

Thank you. And Happy New Year.
