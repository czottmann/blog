**Chocolate Covered SQL.** [This particular entry][1] at [The Daily WTF][2] is hilarious. Even tho it’s unbelievable wrong, the screenshot of this one Google Accounts captcha page is hilarious.

**Nerds!** You know you’re a nerd when you read a spam email with the subject “Do You SUFFER from CVS?” (in this case the acronym stands for “computer vision syndrome”—whatever that may be), and the first thing that comes to your mind is “Yes, Subversion is so much better”.

**Snow.** The winter has finally arrived. About time.
