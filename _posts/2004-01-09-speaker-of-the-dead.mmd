After reading _Ender's Game_ a couple of months ago, I've almost immediately
put all Ender books I could find on my Amazon wishlist. This X-Mas, I got the
four next books in the series.

Tonight, I've finished _Speaker of the Dead_. What an exceptional book. Wow.
Even the excellent _Ender's Game_ looks pale in comparison… Not sure what else
to say, still to overwhelmed.
