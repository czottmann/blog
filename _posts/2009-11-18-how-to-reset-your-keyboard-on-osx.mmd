Somehow, after connecting my new Logitech G9 Laser mouse tonight, two keys on
my MS Natural Ergo keyboard were swapped. Highly annoying. After some digging
around the Googles, I learned that in order to "reset" your keyboard —i.e.
making OSX forget your keyboard type— all you have to do is a


rm /Library/Preferences/com.apple.keyboardtype.plist


Once done, disconnect the keyboard, plug it in again, and the _"New keyboard
found, wot is it?"_ dialog will pop up again. Problem solved, case closed.

Thanks to [Riccardo Raneri][1], on whose blog I found this hint. Credit where
it's due.
