**Windy.** [Outside][1] a storm is brewing that is _assumed_ to end all life in Germany. Everywhere. We’re all going to die! Is Jesus coming back, bringing his lawyers? No idea. I just hope we’ll still have a roof in the morning.

**New keyboard.** [Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000][2], excellent even on a Mac, thanks to the surprisingly flexible IntelliType software. I love Apple hardware, but the glaring lack of an ergonomic keyboard is nothing short of a _shame_.
