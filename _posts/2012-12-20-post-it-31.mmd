**I've built a thing you can buy.**  It's called [Servus](https://servus.io) and is a quick-upload Dropbox tool for Mac that supports custom themes for your uploads' preview pages.  There is a 14-day trial, and until the end of days I have the aptly named [APOCALYP-SALE 2012](http://blog.servus.io/post/38140138904/announcing-apocalyp-sale-2012) going on.  ;)

**A Land Without Guns.** [How Japan Has Virtually Eliminated Shooting Deaths - The Atlantic](http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/07/a-land-without-guns-how-japan-has-virtually-eliminated-shooting-deaths/260189/): A fascinating look at the differences between gun acceptance, law and control in the US and Japan.

**We're doing fine!**  [The U.S. Could Learn from Germany’s High-Tech Manufacturing](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=us-could-learn-germany-high-tech-manufacturing): Why Germany is still going strong.  It's interesting to read a take of someone from the outside.

**A pure JS docco implementation.**  [doccoh](https://github.com/rozmiarek/doccoh) is good ol' [docco](http://jashkenas.github.com/docco/) minus the dependency on pygmentize (which is Python) — instead doccoh relies on [highlight.js](http://softwaremaniacs.org/soft/highlight/en/).  I like it because it's much easier to install in a "pure" node.js/npm environment.  Works as advertised.

**And that's what you get for free.**  The Atlantic on the [Instagram "privacy" monetization](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/12/12/why-you-should-want-to-pay-for-software-instagram-edition/266367/).  This is why I try to pay for things I really like and use heavily — Pinboard, Dropbox, Evernote, to name but a few.  If you're outraged about the Instagram news, then I suggest you bookmark [Hendrik's comprehensive timeline on any free, commercial service ever](http://sloblog.io/0GE5USGsskE) for future reference.

**Overview.**  A 19 minute short about _"astronauts’ life-changing stories of seeing the Earth from the outside – a perspective-altering experience often described as the Overview Effect."_  It's worth your time, I think.
