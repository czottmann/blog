The more my little WoW toon is nearing lvl70 (he’s @69 now), the less space in
my mind is occupied by the game. I am actually thinking about personal coding
again, i.e. building more stuff outside the office.

I am not relieved or shocked by this observation, it feels right. My love for
the game isn’t decreasing, neither is my love for coding increasing. Both stay
the same, yet _something_ is changing once again.
